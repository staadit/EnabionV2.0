Goal  
----  
Describe the email -> Intent integration for R1.0 so that implementation is clear and robust.

Scope / checklist  
------------------
- [ ] Define the standard address format (e.g. `intent@org.enabion.com` or similar pattern).
- [ ] Specify how email subject, body, recipients and attachments map to Intent fields.
- [ ] Define limits and handling rules for attachments (size, types, what is ignored in R1.0).
- [ ] Describe language detection / selection for the Intent Coach based on incoming email.
- [ ] Define basic security/abuse rules (spam, spoofing, who is allowed to create Intents this way).
- [ ] List edge cases (empty email, multiple threads, forwarding, etc.) and how we handle them.

Workflow hint  
-------------
- Normal flow: Backlog -> In progress -> For CEO -> Done.
