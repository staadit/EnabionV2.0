Goal  
----  
Define a clear Definition of Done and minimal dev standards for R1.0 so we ship predictable, testable increments.

Scope / checklist  
------------------
- [ ] Define Definition of Done per major R1.0 epic (Intent, pipeline, Avatars, NDA, multi-tenant).
- [ ] Specify minimal test level (unit / integration / e2e) for each type of change.
- [ ] Describe basic branching & release strategy for R1.0 (environments, feature flags if any).
- [ ] Define minimal telemetry / tracking we expect in the app for learning from MVP usage.
- [ ] Document how issues move on the board (Backlog -> In progress -> For CEO -> Done).

Workflow hint  
-------------
- Normal flow: Backlog -> In progress -> For CEO -> Done.
