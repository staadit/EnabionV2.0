## Goal
Track and govern specification documents (Phase1_MVP-Spec, Playbook refs, Implementation Plan) so teams use a single, versioned source-of-truth and links from issues/projects remain consistent.

## Scope / checklist
- [x] Maintain index of core specs (Phase1_MVP-Spec.md, Enabion_Playbook_v2.3.md, Implementation Plan v0.4) with links and current status.
- [ ] Define document ownership and update cadence for R1.0/R1.1 sections.
- [ ] Ensure each epic links to its canonical spec section (issues #1-#13).
- [x] Track ERD and other assets locations (e.g., docs/assets/bcos-data-model-v1.png) and update links when regenerated.
- [ ] Add "Document control" note to new spec files with source-of-truth issue reference.
- [x] Periodically reconcile GitHub issues vs spec updates (log changes in docs/log/log-YYYY-MM-DD.md).
