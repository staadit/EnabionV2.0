Goal  
----  
Define the first version of TrustScore methodology for R1.0 and how it will evolve into full Trust Graph later.

Scope / checklist  
------------------
- [ ] List signals used in TrustScore MVP (profile completeness, responsiveness, basic behaviour).
- [ ] Define how these signals are combined into a score or status visible to users in R1.0.
- [ ] Describe fairness principles (neutral starting point for new orgs, anti-gaming basics).
- [ ] Define what is shown to users vs what stays internal.
- [ ] Outline how this will evolve in R3.0 (DeliveryFactor, RiskFactor, BehaviourFactor, Trust Graph).
- [ ] Ensure consistency with Data & Event Model v1.

Workflow hint  
-------------
- Normal flow: Backlog -> In progress -> For CEO -> Done.
