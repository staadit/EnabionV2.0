## Goal
Break down R1.0 (Phase1_MVP-Spec) into epics, user stories and dev issues so the board reflects the full implementation scope for R1.0.

## Scope / checklist
- List main epics/workstreams (Intent, Avatars, Pipeline, NDA, Email integration, TrustScore, Auth/Org, Observability, Security/Privacy).
- Draft user stories per persona (X-BD/AM, X-CEO/COO, X-PM, Y-BD) covering the R1.0 scope.
- Create dev issues (type:dev) linked to doc-epics; apply milestone R1.0 and appropriate labels.
- Ensure each story/issue references its canonical spec section (Phase1_MVP-Spec, BCOS Data & Event Model, Architecture, AI Gateway, etc.).
- Prepare initial board grouping (epic/story/issue) to make progress visible.

## Tasks
- [ ] Inventory R1.0 scope from Phase1_MVP-Spec and related docs (#1–#4).
- [ ] Draft user stories for each persona (X-BD/AM, X-CEO/COO, X-PM, Y-BD) mapped to features.
- [ ] Create dev issues (type:dev) for near-term delivery; link to relevant doc-epics and set milestone R1.0.
- [ ] Add cross-links and labels (area:*, type:code/dev, release:R1.0, priority where known).
- [ ] Update project board to reflect epic/story/issue structure.

## Definition of Done
- Stories and dev issues exist for all R1.0 scope areas and are linked to their doc-epics.
- Milestone R1.0 set on created issues; labels applied (area/type/release/priority).
- Board shows clear mapping epic -> stories -> dev issues for R1.0.
