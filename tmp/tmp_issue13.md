## Goal
Translate the R1.1 backlog (Org Dashboard & Multi-Seat) into epics, user stories and dev issues aligned with Phase1 scope for R1.x.

## Scope / checklist
- Identify R1.1 themes from Implementation Plan (Org Dashboard, multi-seat, reporting/analytics).
- Draft epics and user stories for R1.1 (personas: X-CEO/COO, X-BD/AM, X-PM, multi-seat admins).
- Prepare placeholder dev issues (type:dev) with milestone R1.1 and labels; link to future doc-epics when created.
- Ensure references to R1.0 specs where dependencies exist.
- Outline board structure for R1.1 (epic/story/issue).

## Tasks
- [ ] Extract R1.1 requirements from Implementation Plan.
- [ ] Draft epics and user stories for R1.1 personas.
- [ ] Create initial dev issue placeholders with milestone R1.1 and labels (area/type/release/priority).
- [ ] Link stories/issues to doc-epics once those epics are created; note dependencies on R1.0 work.
- [ ] Set up project grouping for R1.1 items on the board (Backlog for now).

## Definition of Done
- Epics/stories for R1.1 captured and linked (or ready to link) to corresponding doc-epics.
- Issues carry milestone R1.1 and correct labels.
- Board has a clear R1.1 lane (Backlog) with epics/stories/issues visible.
