## Goal

Define the initial BCOS Data & Event Model v1 for R1.0 so backend and AI work on one shared canonical model, fully aligned with the Enabion Playbook and the R1.0 Implementation Plan.

## Scope / checklist

- Define core entities for R1.0 (Model 1 - Standard):
  - Org, User, **Contact**, Intent, Engagement (pre-sales), Event, NDA, TrustScoreSnapshot.
  - Add a minimal **Outcome** skeleton as a future-use entity for Deliver/Expand (R2.0+), clearly marked as "not implemented in R1.0".
- Specify fields and relationships for all entities (not only names), including:
  - multi-tenant scoping (e.g. `orgId` / `tenantId` on all records),
  - basic RBAC structure for R1.0 roles (Owner, BD/AM, Viewer/CEO) on Org/User level.
- Define full list of R1.0 events:
  - `INTENT_CREATED` / `INTENT_UPDATED`
  - `AVATAR_SUGGESTION_ISSUED` / `AVATAR_SUGGESTION_ACCEPTED` / `AVATAR_SUGGESTION_REJECTED`
  - `MATCH_LIST_CREATED`
  - `NDA_ACCEPTED`
  - `COMMIT_DECISION_TAKEN`
- For each event, define the event payload schema:
  - shared envelope fields (e.g. `eventId`, `type`, `occurredAt`, `actorUserId`, `orgId`, `entityType`, `entityId`),
  - event-specific fields and minimal metadata needed for AI, audit and analytics.
- Map each event to steps in the Enabion 5-Step Partnership Lifecycle:
  - Clarify, Match & Align, Commit & Assure (implemented in R1.0),
  - Deliver, Expand (placeholders only for R2.0+, no functional events yet).
- Document ID strategy and versioning:
  - how IDs are generated for entities and events,
  - how we version schema changes without breaking R1.0 data.
- Describe how we keep the model ready for R2.0+:
  - Deliver & Expand flows,
  - Issues/Disputes and Outcome log,
  - TrustScore & Trust Graph integration, at least on the level of future fields and relations.
- Add simple ERD / diagrams for the BCOS Core & Event Model:
  - stored in the repo (e.g. `/docs/assets/bcos-data-model-v1.png`),
  - referenced from the main spec document.
- Ensure the whole R1.0 Data & Event Model lives as a dedicated section in the shared spec file:
  - `docs/Phase1_MVP-Spec.md` -> section "BCOS Data & Event Model v1 (MVP)".

## Tasks

- [x] [Ewa] Create (or reuse if it already exists) the file `docs/Phase1_MVP-Spec.md` with a clear structure for R1.0 specs (Product, Data & Event Model, Architecture, AI Gateway, Security, etc.).
- [x] [Ewa] Add a section **"BCOS Data & Event Model v1 (MVP)"** in `Phase1_MVP-Spec.md`:
      - describe all core entities (Org, User, Contact, Intent, Engagement (pre-sales), Event, NDA, TrustScoreSnapshot, Outcome skeleton),
      - list key fields and relationships, including multi-tenant scoping and basic RBAC assumptions.
- [x] [Ewa] Define the full R1.0 event catalogue in the same section:
      - include the event list from this issue,
      - for each event, provide a JSON-like payload example and the mapping to affected entities.
- [x] [Ewa] Add a mapping table **Event -> 5-Step Lifecycle step**:
      - show which events belong to Clarify, Match & Align, Commit & Assure,
      - mark Deliver/Expand as "future step - placeholders only".
- [x] [Ewa] Document ID & versioning strategy:
      - entity IDs (e.g. UUID/ULID) and event IDs,
      - how we evolve schema between R1.0 and later releases.
- [x] [Ewa] Prepare a simple ERD diagram for the R1.0 BCOS data model:
      - export it as an image under `/docs/assets/bcos-data-model-v1.png`,
      - embed it into `Phase1_MVP-Spec.md` under the Data & Event Model section.
- [x] [Ewa] Cross-check consistency with:
      - Issue #1 (MVP - Product Spec R1.0),
      - Issue #3 (Architecture Overview - MVP),
      - Issue #4 (AI Gateway & Avatars - Design & Guardrails),
      - Issue #5 (Security & Privacy baseline - Model 1),
      - Issue #11 (Definition of Done & dev standards),
      and update names/terms if anything diverges.
- [ ] [Ewa] Add a short comment to this issue with:
      - links to the relevant sections in `Phase1_MVP-Spec.md`,
      - link or path to the ERD image.

## Relationships
- Related to #1 [M0] MVP - Product Spec R1.0
- Related to #3 [M0] Architecture Overview - MVP (R1.0)
- Related to #4 [M0] AI Gateway & Avatars - Design & Guardrails (R1.0)
- Related to #5 [M0] Security & Privacy baseline - Model 1 (MVP)
- Related to #11 [M1] Definition of Done & dev standards (R1.0)

## Definition of Done

- [x] `docs/Phase1_MVP-Spec.md` exists in the repo and contains a section titled **"BCOS Data & Event Model v1 (MVP)"**.
- [x] The section fully describes all core R1.0 entities (Org, User, Contact, Intent, Engagement (pre-sales), Event, NDA, TrustScoreSnapshot) including:
      - key fields and relationships,
      - multi-tenant scoping and basic RBAC assumptions.
- [x] A minimal **Outcome** entity skeleton and future Issue/Dispute hooks are defined for R2.0+, clearly marked as "not implemented in R1.0".
- [x] The R1.0 event catalogue is defined with:
      - event list,
      - payload schemas,
      - mapping to 5-Step Lifecycle and to entities.
- [x] ID and versioning rules for entities and events are documented in the spec.
- [x] A simple ERD diagram of the BCOS data model is committed to the repo and referenced from the spec.
- [ ] This issue has links (in comments) to the relevant spec section(s) and ERD, so other issues (#1, #3, #4, #5, #8, #10) can reference it as the canonical model.
- [x] Relationships to the key dependent epics (#1, #3, #4, #5, #11) are set in GitHub so the board view shows this as a core M0 dependency.
