Goal  
----  
Define the minimum viable Security & Privacy baseline for R1.0 (Model 1 - Standard) consistent with future NIS2 / AI Act requirements.

Scope / checklist  
------------------
- [ ] Define role model: Owner, Manager, Contributor, Viewer.
- [ ] Describe access rules for Intents and related data inside one organisation.
- [ ] Specify encryption decisions (in transit, at rest, logs).
- [ ] Define minimal audit log (who viewed/edited which Intent, who accepted NDA, etc.).
- [ ] Describe basic data retention rules for R1.0 (what can be deleted, what must stay).
- [ ] Prepare a short "Security & Privacy Note" for customers (non-technical PDF/markdown).

Workflow hint  
-------------
- Normal flow: Backlog -> In progress -> For CEO -> Done.
