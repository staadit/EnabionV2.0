Issue #53 implemented on dev: enforced tenant isolation by scoping Events/Attachments to req.user (removed orgId/role/userId query trust + added AuthGuard), added Org Members API (Owner-only list/create with safe Prisma select and reset-token flow), centralized UserRole types, updated frontend attachments proxy to forward cookies only, and refactored related tests. Backend test suite passed.
