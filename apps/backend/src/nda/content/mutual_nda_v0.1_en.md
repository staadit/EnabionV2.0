## 1. Purpose
The Parties wish to exchange certain information for the purpose of evaluating and/or pursuing potential business cooperation, including pre-sales discussions and possible project engagement(s) facilitated by the Enabion platform (the "**Purpose**").

## 2. Definitions
### 2.1 "Confidential Information"
"**Confidential Information**" means any non-public information disclosed by or on behalf of a Party ("**Disclosing Party**") to the other Party ("**Receiving Party**"), whether in written, oral, visual, electronic or any other form, that is:
- marked or identified as confidential, or
- reasonably should be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure.

Confidential Information includes, without limitation: business plans, pricing, client information, proposals, software, source code, product roadmaps, technical data, security information, and any analyses, notes, summaries or derivatives made by the Receiving Party that contain or reflect such information.

### 2.2 "Representatives"
"**Representatives**" means a Party's employees, officers, directors, contractors, affiliates, professional advisors, and agents who have a need to know Confidential Information for the Purpose and are bound by confidentiality obligations at least as protective as those in this Agreement.

### 2.3 Platform data levels (L1/L2)
For the MVP, the Parties may label information as:
- **L1 (No-NDA Zone)**: information intended to be shareable without an NDA (e.g., high-level summaries).
- **L2 (NDA-Required)**: information that must not be disclosed to the other Party unless the Mutual NDA is accepted.

This Agreement governs L2 disclosures. L1 information may still be treated as Confidential Information if it meets the definition in Section 2.1.

## 3. Confidentiality Obligations
The Receiving Party shall:
1) use the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information solely for the Purpose;
2) keep the Confidential Information strictly confidential and protect it using at least the same degree of care it uses to protect its own confidential information, and no less than reasonable care;
3) not disclose the Confidential Information to any third party except to its Representatives who have a need to know for the Purpose;
4) ensure that its Representatives comply with this Agreement; and
5) not copy, reverse engineer or decompile Confidential Information (including software) except as strictly necessary for the Purpose and as permitted by law.

## 4. Exclusions
Confidential Information does not include information that the Receiving Party can demonstrate with written records:
a) is or becomes publicly available through no breach of this Agreement;
b) was lawfully known by the Receiving Party prior to disclosure;
c) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information; or
d) is lawfully obtained from a third party without restriction.

## 5. Compelled Disclosure
If the Receiving Party is required by law, regulation, court order or governmental authority to disclose Confidential Information, it shall (to the extent legally permitted) provide prompt written notice to the Disclosing Party and reasonably cooperate to seek protective treatment. The Receiving Party may disclose only the minimum amount required.

## 6. Return / Destruction
Upon written request by the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party shall promptly return or destroy (and certify destruction of) the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information, except that the Receiving Party may retain:
- one archival copy solely for legal/compliance purposes, and/or
- copies stored automatically as part of routine system backups, provided such copies remain protected and are not accessed except for backup/restore operations.

## 7. No License / No Obligation
No license or other rights are granted under this Agreement by disclosure of Confidential Information, whether by implication or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement obligates either Party to proceed with any transaction or relationship.

## 8. No Warranty
All Confidential Information is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. The Disclosing Party does not guarantee completeness or accuracy.

## 9. Term and Survival
### 9.1 Term
This Agreement begins on the Effective Date and continues for **two (2) years**, unless terminated earlier by either Party upon thirty (30) days' written notice.

### 9.2 Survival
The confidentiality obligations in this Agreement survive termination for **three (3) years** from the date of termination; however, with respect to trade secrets, such obligations survive as long as the information remains a trade secret under applicable law.

## 10. Remedies
The Parties acknowledge that unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential Information may cause irreparable harm. The Disclosing Party is entitled to seek injunctive or equitable relief in addition to any other remedies available at law.

## 11. Governing Law and Jurisdiction
This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of **{{GOVERNING_LAW}}**, excluding its conflict-of-laws rules.  
The courts of **{{JURISDICTION}}** shall have exclusive jurisdiction, except that a Party may seek injunctive relief in any competent court.

## 12. Miscellaneous
- **Entire Agreement.** This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties regarding the Purpose and supersedes prior discussions on confidentiality for the Purpose.
- **Amendments.** Any amendment must be in writing and agreed by both Parties.
- **Assignment.** Neither Party may assign this Agreement without the other Party's written consent, except to an affiliate in connection with a merger, acquisition or sale of substantially all assets.
- **Severability.** If any provision is held invalid, the remainder remains in effect.
- **Notices.** Notices shall be sent to the addresses stated above (or updated by written notice).
- **Electronic Acceptance.** The Parties agree that electronic acceptance (including click-through acceptance in the Enabion application) may constitute valid acceptance of this Agreement, to the extent permitted by applicable law.
- **Governing language.** In case of conflict, the English version prevails.
